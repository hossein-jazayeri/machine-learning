%% ============ Vectorize Logistic Regression ============
%  In this part of the exercise, you will reuse your logistic regression

%  that, you will implement one-vs-all classification for the handwritten
%  digit dataset.

%% ================= Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.
